# An Apple A Day, EECS731-Final-Project, Data Science

_In this project, we looked at the relationship between income, food security and education
performance._

 We wanted to know how income levels influence access to food and educational
outcomes, and how food security affects education. We applied regression, classification and clustering algorithms to our data sets from 2015 to predict these outcomes. We achieved this by using statistical methods to understand what percentage of the impact in education is driven by food scarcity.

### The directory structure
------------

The directory structure of our project looks like this: 

```
