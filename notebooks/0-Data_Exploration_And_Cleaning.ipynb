This will streamline analysis. To do so, we take the average of each attribute for each state-county pair. Recall we already have single observations per state-county pair in the Education dataset, so this will not affect that data. We have multiple observations per state-county pair in the Food dataset because the measurements are taken by census tract. Our reasoning behind taking the average across census tracts is: for a majority of the attributes taking the average makes sense. For the attributes whose values represent counts, the resulting attribute value will not represent the count of people in that county but rather an average of the census tracts in that county. For boolean type variables, the resulting average will represent a percentage (in decimal form) of how many tracts in that county had a value of 1 before combining.\n","\n","Combining the data with the mean() function results in all string variables being dropped.
